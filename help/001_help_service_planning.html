<h1>Service planning interface</h1>

<p>
If your status on the service planning page is 'viewer', you can look at the plan,
download music packages (next to the position labels on the left) and the service plan PDF, 
and participate in the planning conversation.</p>

<p>
If you are a plan editor or administrator, consider the following.
Service planning falls into two major subtasks, which are visually separate:
the left column deals with the scheduling of people and rehearsals, the center column contains the service plan itself.
On the right you can add notes and comments if you are planning as part of a team.
</p>

<h2>Scheduling tasks</h2>
<p>
For scheduling the following steps are supported (it is recommended to observe the chronology):
<ul>
<li>Schedule your rehearsals</li>
<li>Open up positions for volunteering, if you like</li>
<li>If you do get volunteers, schedule them for the positions you had opened up</li>
<li>Schedule all others via the 'schedule person' link</li>
<li>Send out notifications (a link will show at the top left)</li>
<li>Wait for confirmations</li>
<li>Remove disconfirmed positions and repeat the scheduling process as necessary</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Editing the Plan</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Drag an element from the list into the service plan to generate a new element</li>
<li>Edit an element by clicking it</li>
<li>Drag and drop to reposition an element</li>
<li>Shift+click an element to delete it </li>
<li>Alt+drag and drop under a group header to add element to group</li>
<li>Ctrl+alt+drag and drop outside group to detach an element from a group</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Downloading Plan Data</h2>
<p>
At any time you can download the current service plan PDF and PowerPoint file with lyrics slides. 
Music packages are available from the music-note link besides the names of the worship leader 
or worship team members (scheduling section on the left)
