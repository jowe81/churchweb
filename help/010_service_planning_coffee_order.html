<h1>Coffee order</h1>

<p>It is a nice gesture for a leader to bring coffee for their team. You can use this dialogue to quickly and simply generate an order.</p>
<p>Simply check the people that you want to include, and choose their drink. ChurchWeb will remember the drink choice for each person.</p>
<p>When you're done, download and print the order, and take it to Tim Horton's.</p>
